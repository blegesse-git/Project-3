### Technology
* Built as a REACTJS APP using MongoDB, Express and NodeJS. Emails and RSVP confirmations are handled with SendGrid. And MaterialUI is used for the framework.


### Installation
* Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, SendGrid, MaterialUI, NodeJS, React, dotenv

* PULL locally and this app can run through NodeJS


### This project has the following features: 
* Includes a timeline with an ascending list of the events by date. Can create an event which can then have it's own budget, todos and RSVP collections in the database. Has a budget tracker with the ability to add transactions which adjust the estalished budget from event creation. Invoices can be created and sent to event client. Then RSVPs can be emailed and tracked for confirmations by email within the app.

* For future development, we are planning to add an event countdown to the planner's next event. As well as a Save Reciept option in the Event Board Tab, a invoice PDF exporter in the Invoices Tab, and mass email input for the RSVPs.
